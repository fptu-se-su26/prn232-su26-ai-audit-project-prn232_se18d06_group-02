Author: Nguyen Sinh Nhat (DE180430)

### Added
- Built a React-based login and registration page in `GearZone-FE`
- Added reusable auth UI components for layout, form sections, input fields, hero panels, and the social sign-in button
- Added frontend auth helpers for login, registration, logout, current-user retrieval, email verification, and verification resend

### Changed
- Configured frontend routing so the authentication flow works correctly after sign-in
- Adjusted auth page behavior for login, registration, and Google sign-in handling
- Updated the Vite path alias configuration for cleaner imports in the frontend codebase

### Fixed
- Fixed frontend import resolution issues related to `@/` path aliases
- Fixed post-login routing so the page no longer loops back incorrectly
- Fixed smaller interaction issues in the auth screen flow

### AI-assisted
- Used Claude Code in a limited way to review the implemented frontend and highlight a few issues for manual verification
- Final code changes and validation were performed manually by the author
